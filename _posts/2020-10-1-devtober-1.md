I would like to say that I'm not a very good writer but for my first Devtober, I'll try to make an article every day. Besides, I have a fulltime job as a Head of Software Engineering and so most of my work on this game jam / personal challenge will be done in 2-4 hours time box in the evening.

### Log

Most of my evening has been dedicated to finding what kind of game I want to build.

**Ground truth**

- I'll build a 2D game as it's my favorite style
- I want to improve my skills in pixel art
- It has to be a simple game to keep my motivation

Based on the previous assumptions, I started to read all the game pitches that people shared on the [devtober discord](https://discord.gg/nTTsbG). I found various inspirations that led me to the following list for my game:

- Collection game like pokemon with a simple story
- Fighting game like "La Brute" (old french web-based multiplayer game)
- Puzzle game based on 4th+ dimensions
- Survival game with resources management
- 2D Sandbox Minecraft-like game (I've always wanted to do one)

I've written the ideas in my preference order and how I see (for me) the difficulty increase in my ideas. Finally, these ideas will have a theme guideline given by the [Ludum Dare 47](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/) (which fortunately started at the same time).

That's all for my first evening on the Devtober! More will come tomorrow :smile:
