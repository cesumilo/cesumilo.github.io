**Context**

Today I worked on three different aspects of the game. First, I drew the first walls of the space station and I built the first iteration of the space station tileset.

Secondly, I implemented the collision system. Now the player is constrained to the space station area.

Finally, I developed a little script to make the active camera follow the player in the middle of the viewport.

### Conclusion

Nothing special, but little advancements!
